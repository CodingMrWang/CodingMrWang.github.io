###What is Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed high throughput message system.
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platfom.

###Advantages
Low delay: has to power to deal with data with time complexity of O(1).

High throughput: Can support over 100000 data per second in each low quality machine.

Horizontal expansion: Support message partition among Kafka brokers, distributed consumer and support horizontal expansion.

Sequence: In each partition, messages are sequential.
Multiple Scenes: Support offline data processing and real-time data processing.

###Kafka framework

###Topic&Parititon&Segment

Each data record contains a key-value pair and a timestamp, the timestamp is mainly used in streaming process.

Each topic is a messsge group.

Each topic contains multiple paritions, each parition is like a folder in different machine which contributes the high throughput of Kafka.

All data are stored in disk sequentially, the older file in each parition would be delted.

###Producer

When producer send message:
Producer is Asynchronous, if want it to be Synchronous, use flush()

How producer guarantees sequence:
Use queue and retry mechanism
set max.in.flight.requests.per.connection = 1
message two will wait message one be sent successfully.

Routing strategy:
partitioner.class

```java
public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes, Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {
	List<PartitionInfo> partition = cluster.partitionsForTopic(topic);
	int numPartitions = partitions.size();
	if (keyButes == null) {
		int nextValue = counter.getAndIncrement();
		List<PartitionInfo> availablePartitions = cluster.availablePartitionsForTopic(topic);
		if (availablePartitions.size() > 0) {
			int part = Utils.toPositive(nextValue) % availablePartitions.size();
			return availablePartitions.get(part).partition();
		} else {
			// no partitions are available, give a non-available partition
			return Utils.toPositive(nextValue) % numPartitions;
			}
	} else {
	    // has the keyBytes to choose a partition
		return Utils.toPositive(Utils.murmur2(keyBytes)) % numPartitions;
	}
	
```

###Consumer Group

Each parition can only be consumed by one consumer.

![consumer](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fucz1kvebtj31110hf1ad.jpg)

When a new consumer enter or quit, paritions will be allocated to consumer again.

![rebalance](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fucz7hpiwwj313n0mgtrj.jpg)

Kafka uses centralized reblance.

1. A coordinator read all topics from Zookeeper and listen the changes of all topics and entry of consumers.

2. It choose a leader for each group and leader send rebalance plan to coordinator through SyncGroup. 

3. Other member get reblance plan from Coordinator through SyncGroup.

###High availability mechanism

Data replication 

![replication](https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fuczflmpwmj313h0k6gwm.jpg)

Followers pull data from leader

####Failover

![failover](https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fuczqt4b3lj313f0m8153.jpg)

####If all replicas fails

1. Wait for one of replica in ISR recover and choose it to be the leader
	
	* Long wait time, reduce availability.
	* If all replicas in ISR would not recover, the partition will die.
	
2. Choose the replic who first recover to be the leader no matter it is in ISR or not.
	
	* It doesn't contain all commits, may loss data.
	* High  availability
