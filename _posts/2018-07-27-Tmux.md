Tmux is really useful during work, espically when you run a program on a virtual machine and it may last for a long time. Using tmux could allow you close your mac and check the process when you want later.

install tmux in mac

```
brew install tmux
```
Start Tmux

```
tmux
```
When you are in the shell main process

```
tmux new -s hello             create a new session named hello
tmux ls                       list all tmux sessions
tmux a                        go back to last session
tmux kill-session -t hello    kill hello session
tmux kill-server              kill all sessions
```
