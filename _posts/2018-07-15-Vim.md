### Vim

Vim is a really powerful text editor, when I had an internship in ByteDance, my leader kept encouraging me to use vim and stop using pycharm. So I decided to conclude those hot keys in vim and kept practicing it. This do speed up the workflow. 


### Move Inside the whole program

```
k  move up one line
j  move down one line
h  move left one line
l  move right one line
```
move in a larger range

```
crtl+f  page down
crtl+b  page up
(       move to the start of current sentense
)       move to the start of next sentence
{       move to the start of current paragraph
}       move to the start of next paragraph
gg      move to the start of first line of the program
G       move to the start of last line of the program
NG or Ngg  move to the start of Nth line of the program
H       move to the first line of the screen
M       move to the middle of the screen
L       move to the end of the screen
*       search current word
```

### Move inside in one line

```
w       move to the start of next word
e       move to the end of current word
b       move to the start of the word before
0       move to the start of current line
^       move to the first none empty word
$       move to the end of current line
g_      move to the last non empty word
fx      move to the first x after current position
Nfx     move the the Nth x after current position
tx      move to the word begfore x
F and T the opposite direction to f and t
```

### Search and match

```bash
/word   seach for the word in the program
n       go to next match word
N       go to last match word
```
